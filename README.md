This is a set of mods developed for the [mc-runtime-test](https://github.com/headlesshq/mc-runtime-test) Github action.
The action allows you to run the Minecraft Java client inside your Github CI/CD pipeline for testing purposes.

The mods in this repository all do the same thing:
When the game is ready, they join a SinglePlayer world, possibly execute all registered
[gametests](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/minecraft/creator/documents/gametestgettingstarted?view=minecraft-bedrock-stable)
and then exit the game signaling success or failure via the exit code.

Mc-Runtime-Test-Mods can be configured via a few System properties.
These are listed and documented [here](api/src/main/java/io/github/headlesshq/mcrtapi/McRuntimeTest.java).
You can set these properties in the mc-runtime-test action like this:
```yaml
uses: 3arthqu4ke/mc-runtime-test@3.0.0
with:
  mc: 1.21.4
  modloader: fabric
  regex: .*fabric.*
  mc-runtime-test: fabric
  java: ${{ env.java_version }}
  headlessmc-command: -lwjgl --retries 2 --jvm "-D<systemProperty>=<value> -Djava.awt.headless=true"
```
If you run the game with xvfb the -lwjgl flag is not needed.
For more information how the command works checkout the [headlessmc](https://github.com/3arthqu4ke/headlessmc) launcher that mc-runtime-test uses.

The Mc-Runtime-Test-Mod has been written with [unimined](https://github.com/unimined/unimined)
which allows us to support forge, neoforge and fabric.
Additionally, we use [manifold](https://github.com/manifold-systems/manifold) for its Java Pre-Processor, 
which allows us to support all the following Minecraft versions within one code base:

Versions marked with :warning: have not been tested yet, HeadlessMc should support them, though.

# Running your own tests
MC-Runtime-Test does not provide a framework for full integration tests.
You can, however, use Minecraft's own [Game-Test Framework](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/creator/article/get-started-gametest-framework).
MC-Runtime-Test will basically execute the `/test runall` command after joining the world.
On Neoforge/Lexforge gametest discovery does really not work in production, you might need to register
them themselves and use other [hacks](https://github.com/headlesshq/mc-runtime-test/blob/main/gametest/src/main/java/me/earth/clientgametest/mixin/MixinGameTestRegistry.java)
to get the structure templates correctly, but we are working on it.
You can also use the `headlessmc-command` input to specify additional SystemProperties with the `--jvm` flag.
E.g. `-DMcRuntimeGameTestMinExpectedGameTests=<int>` to specify how many gametests you expect to be executed
at minimum and otherwise fail if not enough gametests have been found.
